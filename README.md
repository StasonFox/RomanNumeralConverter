# RomanNumeralConverter
#### Description: Second JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures project from FreeCodeCamp: Roman Numeral Converter
Convert the given number into a roman numeral.

This project is a Roman numeral converter. I created an empty string and an object containing the Roman numerals and their associated numbers. I iterated through the object, created a while loop saying that while the number is greater than or equal to the object key, add key to string and subtract the object key from number. I then returned string.
